here's some scripts I find useful:

	{256,}colors.sh prints pretty terminal test colors
	dwmclock.sh     is my dwm status bar
	ioline.sh       tail -f's a file and overlays a prompt line at the bottom (I use it for ii)
	screenr.sh      rotates my screen
	uii.sh          is a utility wrapper for ii and ioline
	uniglyph.sh     is a unicode glyph selector
	wineprog.sh     an old wine wrapper to start some common programs
	wp.sh           sets my wallpaper randomly
